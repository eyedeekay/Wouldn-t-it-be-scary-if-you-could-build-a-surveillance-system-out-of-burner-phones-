# Tanks(From Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/t1xnnc/tanks_used_in_urban_areas_have_a_number_of/)

DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert. This is archived information from a reddit thread.
It may save your life or it may get you killed. Use it at your own risk. The "Big-ass
sheet of ice" idea seems like it could be a straightforward winner, though.

- The engine needs to breathe, so throw your molotov cocktails at whatever looks like
an intake for the engine. It has rubber belts, hoses, and fuel lines.
- Tanks are a logistical nightmare. They need a supply chain a mile long for service
parts, and especially fuel. They can usually only go about 300 miles on improved roads
on one tank of fuel. Stop the supply line, and a tank is just a giant pile of useless
iron.
- Apparently, most tanks are stupidly easy to break into. Also, tankies often put their
gear on the outside of the tank because there isn't much room inside.
- If you throw feces on the tank's parts where hands go, it's gross and might make the
tankies sick.
- Tanks like to crush things. Leave a crushable thing in the open where tanks go, and
fill it with explosives. Bonus points if it damages the road badly and the tank sinks
in.
- It's winter. Water freezes. Be a shame if big parts of their route were a nice sheet
of ice coated in oil and dish soap.
- Take down street signs. Don't let the enemy know where they are. Move signs to the
wrong streets. Tanks are super heavy, so try to direct them to streets that can't hold
their weight. They can't move if they break through to the sewer.
- Break the tracks if you have explosives. Tracks are also terrible for catching stuff
like barbed wire/concertina wire. Line the streets with anything that can get sucked
in and tangle up.

- The U.S. ARMY likes to fight at night because we have thermal imagers. Thermal picks
up heat, so you can not hide behind a bush, but anything that is ambient temperature
just looks like a black square. They can't see through windows because the glass is
ambient.(IS THIS EVEN TRUE?)
- Cut up cardboard boxes and put them everywhere. The cardboard is the same temperature
as the environment. Hiding behind anything that obscures vision only works if they don't
have thermal. Sheets of cardboard in every bush, tree, etc. Will just be a square in a
thermal imager.(IS THIS EVEN TRUE? See above.)
- Set them up everywhere as distractions. Make a chaos terrain for the enemy.
(MORALE/DISTRACTION? How effective is this)
- You can leave boxes of vodka around and the tankies might decide to get drunk.
(MORALE/DISTRACTION? How effective is this)
- Children's toys scattered on the street, like dolls, can be very disconcerting to see.
Ditto shop manequins. Extra points for creepy music.(MORALE/DISTRACTION? How effective is
this)
- Tanks are bad at urban combat. They need infantry support. Without boots on ground
they're just big targets with poor visibility. Rifles should aim for the periscopes, but
most importantly the sight unit on top of the turret.(STANDS TO REASON: Don't try this
with tanks that have infantry support)
- Visibility is rather poor from an armored vehicle. If you paint dinner plates to look
like mines and set them upsode[sic] down in the street, the tank crew won't be able to
tell if they're real or not.(SLIGHTLY BELIEVABLE BUT SEEMS UNRELIABLE)
