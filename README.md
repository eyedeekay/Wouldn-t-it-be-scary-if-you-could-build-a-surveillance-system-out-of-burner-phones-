# Wouldn't it be scary if you could build a surveillance system out of burner phones?

Boy, it sure would be a shame if surveillance at scale was very easy for regular people
to pull off, wouldn't it? Like pretty much everything is always searching for a connection
these days, it would be pretty scary if a bunch of cheap, off-the-shelf hardware that can
readily be acquired over-the-counter could be turned into an ad-hoc means of monitoring a
person or person's movement through an area.

Perhaps an area that they **definitely should not be in.** Doing things they **definitely**
**should not be fucking doing.**

Take the hint? Good, now here's how to be the worst version of Batman with stuff that you
can probably find or salvage on the cheap, even in emergencies.

## If you're reading this, you have goals:

Among may be:

 - Stay alive!
 - Gather Intelligence!
 - Repel Invaders!
 - Profit!

I'm going to try and help you with the first two. Let's break down the tasks relevant to
this operation for each of those goals.

### Staying Alive

I dunno, I've never been in a war but I'm trying to contribute. If I were in your shoes, job
one would be stay the fuck alive. You do it for your family, you do it for your country, you
do it for you. Dying for your country isn't the goal.

Now that I'm done stating the painfully obvious, maximizing your chances of staying alive means
considering the threats to your existence. This is called "Threat Modeling." It can be a
challenging, multifaceted process, and you're probably already doing it.

### Gathering Intelligence


### Repelling Invaders
